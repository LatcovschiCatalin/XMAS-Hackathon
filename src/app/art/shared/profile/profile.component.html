    <div class="profile-description">
      I am an emotional person who loves attention and cares
      about other peopleâ€™s opinion. My passion regarding art makes
      me to aspire for more. I work in this field for 35 years
      doing different commissioned works. I would want to start a new style in art and to extend my connections in art
      community.
